# Unsupervised learning of anomalous diffusion

> Repository hosting the code of the work '<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx'>Unsupervised learning of anomalous diffusion</a>' authored by Gorka Mu√±oz-Gil, Guillem Guigo and Maciej Lewenstein

In this repository you will the source code of the machine learning architectures used in the work (`autoencoder.py` and `utils.py`), as well as a notebook exemplifying their training and use (`autoencoder.ipynb`). For most of the details on the technical implementation, please check either the notebook or the appendix of the paper.
